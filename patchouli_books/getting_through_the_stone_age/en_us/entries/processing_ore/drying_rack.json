These can be made with various types of wood, but you'll need a flint saw at the very least. Place the clumps of clay on the drying rack and just wait for a while. Drying racks aren't fast, by any means, but they will be a bit faster if exposed to the sun.$()$(br2)$(l:https://github.com/An-Sar/PrimalCore/wiki/Drying-Racks)Click here for info on drying racks.$(/l)"
