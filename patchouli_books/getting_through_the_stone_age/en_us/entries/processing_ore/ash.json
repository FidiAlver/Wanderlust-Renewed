However, you're probably going to need a lot of ash, and the best way to get lots of ash would by lighting log piles on fire. This works similarly to making charcoal, $(l:processing_ore/charcoal)listed above$(/l), except you do not bury the log stacks. Left to burn in the open air will cause the log stacks to eventually burn into a pile of ash."
