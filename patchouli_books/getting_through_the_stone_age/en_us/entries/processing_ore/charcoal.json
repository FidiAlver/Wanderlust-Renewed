Once stripped, you then use an axe to split the logs. You then craft the split logs into log stacks."

If you do not bury the log stack, it will burn into ash rather than charcoal, which can be a useful method of gathering ash when you need it. You can bury multiple log stacks together, and the fire will spread to multiple stacks, so you don't have to bury each stack individually nor light each stack individually."
